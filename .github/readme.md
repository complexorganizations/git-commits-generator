### Q&A

Is it possible to use this to initiate a DoS attack on a git service?
- I'm not sure, and it's not intended for that, so please don't do it.

What is the point of this?
- What I wanted was to be at the top of the list of people with the most commitments.

Isn't it a waste of time to do this?
- Yes, but the objective isn't to prove anything; rather, it's because I'm bored.
